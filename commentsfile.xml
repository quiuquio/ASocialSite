It is useful to note that std::function treats functors (that overload operator()) the same as functions. Weâ€™ll see how to bind arbitrary member functions in a bit. We can also see that lambdas can be encapsulated in std::function objects, thus enabling you to provide a very generic, yet typesafe, callback mechanism.</comment_body><username>pippo</username></comment></comment_root>
