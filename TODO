Usage and notes:
    This previously stated, this is as simple todo list. Very simple.
    Let's use @... if we know who should do what.
    English makes everything sound cooler. Let's use it. Also, we should set 
    tasks' priority simply by position. That's it for me. This note can be
    changed, and it probably should.
        
        Best regards,
        Robert
