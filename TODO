Usage and notes:
    This previously stated, this is as simple todo list. Very simple.
    Let's use @... if we know who should do what.
    English makes everything sound cooler. Let's use it. Also, we should set 
    tasks' priority simply by position. That's it for me. This note can be
    changed, and it probably should.

        Hi,
        Andrea

+Things we have to find out:
- Master the holy technique of sessions and other advanced php functions.
- I have yet to find out if theres a way to "embed" xml in php like linking it and 
    making the page process it and its xsl inside a php page.
    Functions to process an xml file exists in php and Ive added an example of 
    how to do so to the repo, but I couldnt make it work with xml+xsl :(

- Define a generic <div> node to hold "posts";
- Find a way to host asocial website and wsdl online;
- Define the database structure using some smart tool, like an automatic EER to
    database software. Also useful for documentation;

- User authentication and user management modules needed;
- Chat (if aproved);
- Define website features to present;
- Start documentation;
- Can we stop writing in english? @Rob
