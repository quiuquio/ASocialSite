These libraries add a great deal of needed functionality, although it still doesn’t compare to the standard library you get with many other languages.&#13;
&#13;
Two of the new extensions to the standard library are function wrappers and arbitrary function binding, located in the &lt;functional&gt; header.&#13;
&#13;
Function and Bind in &lt;functional&gt;&#13;
The &lt;functional&gt; header has been expanded with a whole slew of new capabilities. Amongst those are two main things that stand out as being of particular use are the function binding capabilities and the generic function container.</post_body><username>pippo</username></post></post_root>
